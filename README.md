# Flahscards

Mobile app built with React Native and Redux, built for Android and iOS, that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those deck.

## Instalation

1. git clone https://github.com/carlosloureda/flashcards.git [folder_name]

With these commands you will run the expo packager and will be able to launch the app
on a device emulator or on a real device. To launch app in a real device please install
the Expo application. On the terminal you will be prompt a QR code that you need to capture
with the expo app.

## Platforms tested
This application has been tested on an Android real device (Android 6.0). I couldn't test
it on an iOS platform.
